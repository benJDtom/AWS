# AWS

This contains my projects done in AWS, and my journey to completion. 

# Website Project
## Inital Planning and considerations
### What
A basic website featuring information about me, my projects and contact information on how I can be reached
### How
There are a few possible ways to host a website within AWS. I could host it on EC2, Lightsail, ECS or using an S3 bucket.

All of which I would be using Route 53 with to obtain a domain name and use to manage the DNS records for the website.
